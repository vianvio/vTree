# angular-vSelect
A select plugin which is a directive building with angularjs.

It's recommanded to change the code to make your own one. The code the very simple.

The events contained in the directive can support the need of cascading selection (ex. choose Country -> city list will change)

To have a quick try, you may get help with a node module 'anywhere' -- npm install -g anywhere, then cd to the angular-vtable folder and code anywhere to start.
or grunt, or gulp, anything you like

If any suggestion, please let me know ~ I will like it, thank you ~
